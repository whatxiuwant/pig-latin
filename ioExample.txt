A file object encapsulates the properties of a file or a path, but it does not contain the methods for creating a file or for writing or reading a file (reffered to as data input and output, or I/O for short). 
In order to perform I/O, you need to create objects using appropriate Java I/O classes.
The object contains the methods for reading data from a file and writing data to a file. 
There are two types of files: text and binary. Text files are essentially characters on disk. 
This section introduces how to read and write strings and numeric values using Scanner and PrintWriter classes. 
We will discuss binary files at a later date.
