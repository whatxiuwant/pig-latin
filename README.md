RULES :

-If "y" is the first letter, it is a consonant. Otherwise, "y" is a vowel.
-All leading consonants are moved to the end of the word, followed by the letters "ay"
-If the word begins with a vowel and ends in a consonant, "ay" is added to the end of the word
-If the word begins with a vowel and ends in a vowel, "yay" is added to the end of the word, unless the resulting word would end in "yyay".
-In this case, only "ay" is added to the end of the word
